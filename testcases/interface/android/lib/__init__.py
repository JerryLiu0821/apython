This directory contains core libraries for apython. These libraries
are guaranteed to work on all supported platforms.

Core libraries install themselves in the android.lib namespace. To use them,
simply add the appropriate import to your test:

import android, android.lib.qxdm

The libraries will then be automatically available in the android.lib
namespace when you instantiate an android object with android.connect().
